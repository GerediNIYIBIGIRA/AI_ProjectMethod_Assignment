Introduction
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is a major public health issue in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America. Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria remains one of the world's deadliest diseases.

Causes and Transmission
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, of which there are five species known to infect humans:

Plasmodium falciparum: The most severe and deadly form.
Plasmodium vivax: Causes recurring malaria; less severe but widespread.
Plasmodium ovale: Similar to P. vivax with milder symptoms.
Plasmodium malariae: Causes chronic infections, often with milder symptoms.
Plasmodium knowlesi: A monkey malaria that can infect humans, mainly in Southeast Asia.
Transmission
Malaria spreads primarily through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, which bite mainly during dusk and dawn. Other modes of transmission include:

Blood transfusion from an infected donor.
Organ transplantation.
Shared use of contaminated needles or syringes.
From mother to child during pregnancy (congenital malaria).
Symptoms
Malaria symptoms typically appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite and may include:

High fever and chills
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Muscle pain and fatigue
Sweating
Cough
In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, confusion, and kidney or liver failure.
Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, malaria can progress to severe illness and death, especially P. falciparum.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing malaria involves clinical evaluation and laboratory tests:

Microscopic Examination: A blood smear under a microscope to detect Plasmodium parasites.
Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs): Detect specific malaria antigens using a blood sample, providing results within 15-30 minutes.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): Detects malaria DNA, used mainly in research or to confirm species when microscopic or RDT results are unclear.
Treatment
Malaria treatment depends on the type of Plasmodium species, the severity of the infection, and the patientâ€™s condition:

Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): The most effective treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
Chloroquine: Effective against P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale but not P. falciparum due to resistance.
Severe Malaria: Treated with intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) artesunate, followed by a complete ACT course once the patient can tolerate oral medication.
Prevention
Preventive measures are critical in reducing malaria transmission:

Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs): Sleeping under mosquito nets treated with insecticide significantly reduces mosquito bites.
Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): Spraying insecticides on walls and other surfaces where mosquitoes rest.
Preventive Medications: Prophylactic antimalarial drugs (e.g., Malarone, Doxycycline) for travelers to high-risk areas.
Vaccination: The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix) has shown partial efficacy against P. falciparum in young children.
Complications
Untreated malaria can lead to severe complications, including:

Cerebral malaria (brain swelling and seizures)
Severe anemia
Organ failure (kidney, liver, lungs)
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
Malaria Statistics and Impact
In 2021, there were an estimated 247 million malaria cases and 619,000 deaths worldwide.
Sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden, with more than 90% of all malaria cases and deaths.
Malaria significantly impacts economies, healthcare systems, and quality of life in affected regions.
Global Efforts in Malaria Control
Various organizations and governments are working towards malaria elimination:

World Health Organization (WHO): Provides guidelines, support, and monitoring of malaria control efforts.
Roll Back Malaria Partnership: A global framework coordinating actions against malaria.
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Funds research, vaccine development, and distribution of preventive tools.
