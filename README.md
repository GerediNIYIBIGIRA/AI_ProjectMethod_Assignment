Introduction
Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. It is a major public health issue in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, and South America. Despite being preventable and treatable, malaria remains one of the world's deadliest diseases.

Causes and Transmission
Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites, of which there are five species known to infect humans:

Plasmodium falciparum: The most severe and deadly form.
Plasmodium vivax: Causes recurring malaria; less severe but widespread.
Plasmodium ovale: Similar to P. vivax with milder symptoms.
Plasmodium malariae: Causes chronic infections, often with milder symptoms.
Plasmodium knowlesi: A monkey malaria that can infect humans, mainly in Southeast Asia.
Transmission
Malaria spreads primarily through the bites of infected Anopheles mosquitoes, which bite mainly during dusk and dawn. Other modes of transmission include:

Blood transfusion from an infected donor.
Organ transplantation.
Shared use of contaminated needles or syringes.
From mother to child during pregnancy (congenital malaria).
Symptoms
Malaria symptoms typically appear 10-15 days after the infective mosquito bite and may include:

High fever and chills
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Muscle pain and fatigue
Sweating
Cough
In severe cases, it can cause jaundice, seizures, confusion, and kidney or liver failure.
Without prompt diagnosis and treatment, malaria can progress to severe illness and death, especially P. falciparum.

Diagnosis
Diagnosing malaria involves clinical evaluation and laboratory tests:

Microscopic Examination: A blood smear under a microscope to detect Plasmodium parasites.
Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDTs): Detect specific malaria antigens using a blood sample, providing results within 15-30 minutes.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR): Detects malaria DNA, used mainly in research or to confirm species when microscopic or RDT results are unclear.
Treatment
Malaria treatment depends on the type of Plasmodium species, the severity of the infection, and the patient’s condition:

Artemisinin-based Combination Therapies (ACTs): The most effective treatment for uncomplicated malaria.
Chloroquine: Effective against P. vivax, P. malariae, and P. ovale but not P. falciparum due to resistance.
Severe Malaria: Treated with intravenous (IV) or intramuscular (IM) artesunate, followed by a complete ACT course once the patient can tolerate oral medication.
Prevention
Preventive measures are critical in reducing malaria transmission:

Insecticide-Treated Nets (ITNs): Sleeping under mosquito nets treated with insecticide significantly reduces mosquito bites.
Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS): Spraying insecticides on walls and other surfaces where mosquitoes rest.
Preventive Medications: Prophylactic antimalarial drugs (e.g., Malarone, Doxycycline) for travelers to high-risk areas.
Vaccination: The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine (Mosquirix) has shown partial efficacy against P. falciparum in young children.
Complications
Untreated malaria can lead to severe complications, including:

Cerebral malaria (brain swelling and seizures)
Severe anemia
Organ failure (kidney, liver, lungs)
Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
Pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)
Malaria Statistics and Impact
In 2021, there were an estimated 247 million malaria cases and 619,000 deaths worldwide.
Sub-Saharan Africa bears the highest burden, with more than 90% of all malaria cases and deaths.
Malaria significantly impacts economies, healthcare systems, and quality of life in affected regions.
Global Efforts in Malaria Control
Various organizations and governments are working towards malaria elimination:

World Health Organization (WHO): Provides guidelines, support, and monitoring of malaria control efforts.
Roll Back Malaria Partnership: A global framework coordinating actions against malaria.
Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation: Funds research, vaccine development, and distribution of preventive tools.

Key facts
Globally in 2022, there were an estimated 249 million malaria cases and 608 000 malaria deaths in 85 countries.
The WHO African Region carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden.
In 2022, the Region was home to 94% of malaria cases (233 million) and 95% (580 000) of malaria deaths.
Children under 5 accounted for about 80% of all malaria deaths in the Region.
 

Overview
Malaria is a life-threatening disease spread to humans by some types of mosquitoes. It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.

The infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.

Symptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.

Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection. 

Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines. Treatments can stop mild cases from getting worse.

Malaria mostly spreads to people through the bites of some infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated, P. falciparum malaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.

There are 5 Plasmodium parasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species – P. falciparum and P. vivax – pose the greatest threat. P. falciparum is the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent. P. vivax is the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa. The other malaria species which can infect humans are P. malariae, P. ovale and P. knowlesi.

Symptoms
The most common early symptoms of malaria are fever, headache and chills.

Symptoms usually start within 10–15 days of getting bitten by an infected mosquito.

Symptoms may be mild for some people, especially for those who have had a malaria infection before. Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important. 

Some types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk. Severe symptoms include:

extreme tiredness and fatigue 
impaired consciousness
multiple convulsions
difficulty breathing
dark or bloody urine
jaundice (yellowing of the eyes and skin) 
abnormal bleeding.
People with severe symptoms should get emergency care right away. Getting treatment early for mild malaria can stop the infection from becoming severe. 

Malaria infection during pregnancy can also cause premature delivery or delivery of a baby with low birth weight.

Disease burden
According to the latest World malaria report, there were 249 million cases of malaria in 2022 compared to 244 million cases in 2021. The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 608 000 in 2022 compared to 610 000 in 2021.

The WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2022 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 78% of all malaria deaths in the Region.

Four African countries accounted for just over half of all malaria deaths worldwide: Nigeria (26.8%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (12.3%), Uganda (5.1%) and Mozambique (4.2%).
Prevention
Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.

Lower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:  

Use mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present
Use mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk
Use coils and vaporizers.
Wear protective clothing.
Use window screens.
Vector control
Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).

Progress in global malaria control is threatened by emerging resistance to insecticides among Anopheles mosquitoes. As described in the latest World malaria report, other threats to ITNs include insufficient access, loss of nets due to the stresses of day-to-day life outpacing replacement, and changing behaviour of mosquitoes, which appear to be biting early before people go to bed and resting outdoors, thereby evading exposure to insecticides.

Chemoprophylaxis
Travellers to malaria endemic areas should consult their doctor several weeks before departure. The medical professional will determine which chemoprophylaxis drugs are appropriate for the country of destination. In some cases, chemoprophylaxis drugs must be started 2–3 weeks before departure. All prophylactic drugs should be taken on schedule for the duration of the stay in the malaria risk area and should be continued for 4 weeks after the last possible exposure to infection since parasites may still emerge from the liver during this period.

Preventive chemotherapies
Preventive chemotherapy is the use of medicines, either alone or in combination, to prevent malaria infections and their consequences. It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.

Preventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA). These safe and cost-effective strategies are intended to complement ongoing malaria control activities, including vector control measures, prompt diagnosis of suspected malaria, and treatment of confirmed cases with antimalarial medicines.

Vaccine
Since October 2021, WHO has recommended broad use of the RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine among children living in regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children. In October 2023, WHO recommended a second safe and effective malaria vaccine, R21/Matrix-M. The availability of two malaria vaccines is expected to make broad-scale deployment across Africa possible. 

Questions and answers on the RTS,S vaccine.

Treatment
Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease, prevents deaths and contributes to reducing transmission. WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based diagnostic testing (through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).

Malaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.

Multiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on: 

the type of malaria 
whether a malaria parasite is resistant to a medicine
the weight or age of the person infected with malaria 
whether the person is pregnant.
These are the most common medicines for malaria:

Artemisinin-based combination therapy medicines are the most effective treatment for P. falciparum malaria.
Chloroquine is recommended for treatment of infection with the P. vivax parasite only in places where it is still sensitive to this medicine.
Primaquine should be added to the main treatment to prevent relapses of infection with the P. vivax and P. ovale parasites. 
Most medicines used are in pill form. Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for injectable medicines.

Antimalarial drug resistance
Over the last decade, partial artemisinin resistance has emerged as a threat to global malaria control efforts in the Greater Mekong subregion. WHO is very concerned about reports of partial artemisinin resistance in Africa, confirmed in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and, most recently, Tanzania. Regular monitoring of antimalarial drug efficacy is needed to inform treatment policies in malaria-endemic countries, and to ensure early detection of, and response to, drug resistance.

For more on WHO’s work on antimalarial drug resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, visit the Mekong Malaria Elimination Programme webpage. WHO has also developed a strategy to address drug resistance in Africa.

Elimination
Malaria elimination is defined as the interruption of local transmission of a specified malaria parasite species in a defined geographical area as a result of deliberate activities. Continued measures to prevent re-establishment of transmission are required.

In 2022, 34 countries reported fewer than 1000 indigenous cases of the disease, up from just 13 countries in 2000. Countries that have achieved at least 3 consecutive years of zero indigenous cases of malaria are eligible to apply for the WHO certification of malaria elimination. Since 2015, 12 countries have been certified by the WHO Director-General as malaria-free, including Maldives (2015), Sri Lanka (2016), Kyrgyzstan (2016), Paraguay (2018), Uzbekistan (2018), Argentina (2019), Algeria (2019), China (2021), El Salvador (2021), Azerbaijan (2023), Tajikistan (2023) and Belize (2023).

Countries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO.

Surveillance
Malaria surveillance is the continuous and systematic collection, analysis and interpretation of malaria-related data, and the use of that data in the planning, implementation and evaluation of public health practice. Improved surveillance of malaria cases and deaths helps ministries of health determine which areas or population groups are most affected and enables countries to monitor changing disease patterns. Strong malaria surveillance systems also help countries design effective health interventions and evaluate the impact of their malaria control programmes.

WHO response
The WHO Global technical strategy for malaria 2016–2030, updated in 2021, provides a technical framework for all malaria-endemic countries. It is intended to guide and support regional and country programmes as they work towards malaria control and elimination.

The strategy sets ambitious but achievable global targets, including:

reducing malaria case incidence by at least 90% by 2030
reducing malaria mortality rates by at least 90% by 2030
eliminating malaria in at least 35 countries by 2030
preventing a resurgence of malaria in all countries that are malaria-free.
Guided by this strategy, the Global Malaria Programme coordinates the WHO’s global efforts to control and eliminate malaria by:

playing a leadership role in malaria, effectively supporting member states and rallying partners to reach Universal Health Coverage and achieve goals and targets of the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria;
shaping the research agenda and promoting the generation of evidence to support global guidance for new tools and strategies to achieve impact;
developing ethical and evidence based global guidance on malaria with effective dissemination to support adoption and implementation by national malaria programmes and other relevant stakeholders; and
monitoring and responding to global malaria trends and threats.

Preventing Malaria in Travelers

A guide for travelers to malarious areas

Many people acquire malaria, a potentially life-threatening disease, during travel to
tropical and subtropical countries. Malaria occurs in most of sub-Saharan Africa,
southern and southeast Asia, Mexico, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Central and
South America, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands. Major
cities in Asia and South America are nearly malaria free; cities in Africa, India, and
Pakistan are not. There is generally less risk of malaria at altitudes above 1500
meters (4500 feet).

Malaria Regions of the World

Malaria and its symptoms Malaria is a serious disease that occurs when an infected
Anopheles mosquito bites a person and injects malaria parasites into the blood.
Although four species of malaria parasites can infect humans and cause illness 
(Plasmodium falciparum, P. malariae, P. vivax, and P. ovale), only falciparum
malaria is potentially life-threatening.

Symptoms of malaria are flu-like and may include fever, chills, muscle aches,
headache, and, sometimes, vomiting, diarrhea, and coughing. Patients with severe
falciparum malaria may develop liver and kidney failure, convulsions, and coma.
Although infections with P. vivax and P. ovale may cause less serious illness, 
parasites may remain dormant in the liver for many months, causing a reappearance
of symptoms months or even years later.

At first, symptoms may be mild. Malaria should be suspected if the traveler has
fever or any of the above symptoms between 1 week after the first possible
exposure to infected mosquitoes and several months after the last exposure. The
period between mosquito bite and onset of illness is usually 7 to 21 days, but this
interval  may be longer when the traveler has taken incomplete or inadequate
malaria prevention measures.

If malaria is suspected, medical help must be sought immediately. A blood sample
should be taken to check for malaria parasites.

About 2% of patients infected with falciparum malaria die, usually because of
delayed treatment. Immediate treatment of falciparum malaria is critical.






Protection against malaria 

No vaccine against malaria is available, but travelers can protect themselves by
using anti-mosquito measures and by taking drugs to prevent malaria.
Avoiding mosquito bites
Avoiding the bites of Anopheles mosquitoes (which usually bite only between dusk
and dawn) is the best way to prevent infection.

To avoid mosquito bites

Apply insect repellent to exposed skin. The recommended repellent contains
20%-35% DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide).
Wear long-sleeved clothing and long pants if you are outdoors at night. 
Use a mosquito net over the bed if your bedroom is not air-conditioned or
screened. For additional protection, 
treat the mosquito net with the insecticide permethrin.
Spray an insecticide or repellent on clothing, as mosquitoes may bite through thin
clothing. 
Spray permethrin or a similar insecticide in your bedroom before going to bed.


Note: Vitamin B and ultrasound devices do not prevent mosquito bites.

Using antimalarial drugs

Travelers to areas where malaria occurs should discuss their travel plans with a
physician well before departure.  Drugs to prevent malaria are usually prescribed
for travelers to malarious areas. Travelers from different countries  may receive
different recommendations, reflecting differences in approach and availability of
medicines in different  countries. Travelers visiting only cities or rural areas where
there is no risk of malaria may not require preventive drugs; an exact itinerary is
necessary to decide the degree of protection required.

Drugs recommended for prevention of malaria in travelers
   
Mefloquine, doxycycline, chloroquine

Strict adherence to the recommended doses and schedules of the antimalarial drug
selected is necessary for effective protection.


Take tablets on the same day each week or, in the case of tablets to be taken daily,
at the same time each day.
Take tablets after meals. 
Take the recommended doses 1 to 2 weeks before travel, throughout the trip, and
for 4 weeks after leaving the malarious area.
Don't stop taking the tablets after arriving home; it is essential to complete the full
dosage.

Drug resistance

Choosing antimalarial drugs has become complicated by the appearance of
drug-resistant strains of malaria.  In Mexico, Central America, Haiti, the
Dominican Republic, and the Middle East, the preventive drug of choice 
is weekly chloroquine. In all other areas of the malarious world the drug of choice
is weekly mefloquine (Lariam*).   If mefloquine cannot be taken, an effective
alternative is daily doxycycline. If neither mefloquine nor doxycycline 
can be taken, chloroquine (with or without proguanil, a drug not available in the
United States) is a third alternative,  but this drug is much less effective in most
areas. If chloroquine is used in drug-resistant areas, a suitable stand-by 
treatment (see  Self-treatment ) should be carried in case malarial symptoms occur
and medical help cannot be obtained within 24 hours.

Side effects of antimalarial drugs

All medicines have some side effects; however, if a serious side effect occurs, the
traveler should seek medical help and discontinue taking the antimalarial drug.
Mild nausea, occasional vomiting, or loose stools are not adequate reasons for
stopping the antimalarial drug. The seriousness of malaria warrants tolerating
temporary side effects.

Self-treatment

The antimalarial drug sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (Fansidar*) can be carried for
self-administration when fever  and flu-like symptoms occur during travel and
prompt medical attention is not available. This is a temporary  measure only, and
medical advice should be sought as quickly as possible. Travelers who become ill
after their return home should never treat their illness themselves. Instead, they
should seek prompt medical attention and inform their doctor of recent travel.

Prevent malaria

During travel to areas in which malaria is present,

Use anti-mosquito measures
Take a drug to prevent malaria
Consult a physician if you get sick

More Information
Malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. Symptoms and signs include fever (which may be periodic), chills, rigors, sweating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, respiratory distress, confusion, seizures, hemolytic anemia, splenomegaly, and renal abnormalities. Diagnosis is by seeing Plasmodium in a peripheral blood smear and by rapid diagnostic tests. Treatment and prophylaxis depend on the Plasmodium species and drug sensitivity and the patient's clinical status. Treatment regimens for acute disease include artemisinin-based combination therapy, the most rapidly acting regimen, the fixed combination of atovaquone and proguanil, and, less commonly, chloroquine, quinine, or mefloquine. Patients infected with P. vivax and P. ovale also receive primaquine or a single dose of tafenoquine to prevent relapse. Prophylaxis is usually with the fixed combination of atovaquone plus proguanil or with doxycycline; chloroquine is used in areas without chloroquine resistance. Terminal treatment with primaquine or tafenoquine is given to patients likely to have been exposed to P. vivax or P. ovale.

Malaria is infection with Plasmodium species. About half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria. Malaria is endemic in Africa, India and other areas of South Asia, Southeast Asia, North and South Korea, Mexico, Central America, Haiti, the Dominican Republic, South America (including northern parts of Argentina), the Middle East (including Turkey, Syria, Iran, and Iraq), and Central Asia. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provides information about specific countries where malaria is transmitted (see CDC: Yellow Fever and Malaria Information, by Country), types of malaria, resistance patterns, and recommended prophylaxis (see CDC: Malaria).

In 2020, there were an estimated 241 million cases of malaria, with 95% of them in Africa (see 2021 World Malaria Report). An estimated 627,000 people died from malaria in 2020, mostly children < 5 years of age. Since 2000, deaths due to malaria have decreased by approximately 30% through the efforts of the RBM (Roll Back Malaria) Partnership to End Malaria, which has > 500 partners (including endemic countries and various organizations and institutions). Despite decades of decline, the number of deaths increased in 2020 as a result of disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Malaria once was endemic in the US. Currently, about 1500 cases occur in the US each year. Nearly all are acquired abroad, but a small number result from blood transfusions or rarely from transmission by local mosquitoes that feed on infected immigrants or returning travelers.

Pathophysiology of Malaria
The Plasmodium species that infect humans are

P. falciparum

P. vivax

P. ovale

P. malariae

P. knowlesi

Concurrent infection with more than one Plasmodium species is uncommon but can occur.

P. knowlesi is a pathogen in Southeast Asia, particularly in Malaysia. Macaque monkeys are the primary hosts. P. knowlesi is usually acquired by people living or working near or in forests.

The basic elements of the life cycle are the same for all Plasmodium species. Transmission begins when a female Anopheles mosquito feeds on a person with malaria and ingests blood containing gametocytes.

During the following 1 to 2 weeks, gametocytes inside the mosquito reproduce sexually and produce infective sporozoites. When the mosquito feeds on another human, sporozoites are inoculated and quickly reach the liver and infect hepatocytes.

The parasites mature into tissue schizonts within hepatocytes. Each schizont produces 10,000 to 30,000 merozoites, which are released into the bloodstream 1 to 3 weeks later when the hepatocyte ruptures. Each merozoite can invade a red blood cell (RBC) and there transform into a trophozoite.

Trophozoites grow, and most develop into erythrocyte schizonts; schizonts produce further merozoites, which 48 to 72 hours later rupture the RBC and are released in plasma. These merozoites then rapidly invade new RBCs, repeating the cycle. Some trophozoites develop into gametocytes, which are ingested by an Anopheles mosquito. They undergo sexual union in the gut of the mosquito, develop into oocysts, and release infective sporozoites, which migrate to the salivary glands.

Plasmodium Life Cycle

With P. vivax and P. ovale (but not P. falciparum or P. malariae), tissue schizonts may persist as hypnozoites in the liver for years. Relapse of P. ovale has occurred as late as 6 years after an episode of symptomatic malaria, and the infection was transmitted by blood transfusion from a person who was exposed 7 years before donating blood. These dormant forms serve as time-release capsules, which cause relapses and complicate chemotherapy because they are not killed by most antimalarial drugs, which typically act on bloodstream parasites.

The pre-erythrocytic (hepatic) stage of the malarial life cycle is bypassed when infection is transmitted by blood transfusions, by sharing of contaminated needles, or congenitally. Therefore, these modes of transmission do not cause latent disease or delayed recurrences.

Rupture of RBCs during release of merozoites is associated with the clinical symptoms. If severe, hemolysis causes anemia and jaundice, which are worsened by phagocytosis of infected RBCs in the spleen. Anemia may be severe in P. falciparum or chronic P. vivax infection but tends to be mild in P. malariae infection.

Falciparum malaria
Unlike other forms of malaria, P. falciparum causes microvascular obstruction because infected RBCs adhere to vascular endothelial cells. Ischemia can develop with resultant tissue hypoxia, particularly in the brain, kidneys, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis are other potential complications.

Resistance to infection
Most West Africans have complete resistance to P. vivax because their RBCs lack the Duffy blood group, which is involved in attachment of P. vivax to RBCs; many African Americans also have such resistance. The development of Plasmodium in RBCs is retarded in patients with hemoglobin S disease, hemoglobin C disease, thalassemia, G6PD deficiency, or elliptocytosis.

Previous infections provide partial immunity. Once residents of hyperendemic areas leave, acquired immunity wanes over time (months to years), and symptomatic malaria may develop if they return home and become reinfected.

Symptoms and Signs of Malaria
The incubation period is usually

12 to 17 days for P. vivax

9 to 14 days for P. falciparum

16 to 18 days or longer for P. ovale

About 1 month (18 to 40 days) or longer (years) for P. malariae

However, some strains of P. vivax in temperate climates may not cause clinical illness for months to > 1 year after infection.

Manifestations common to all forms of malaria include

Fever and rigors—the malarial paroxysm

Anemia

Jaundice

Splenomegaly

Hepatomegaly

Malarial paroxysm is caused by hemolysis of infected RBCs, released merozoites and other malaria antigens, and the inflammatory response they elicit. The classic paroxysm starts with malaise, abrupt chills and fever rising to 39 to 41° C, rapid and thready pulse, polyuria, headache, myalgia, and nausea. After 2 to 6 hours, fever falls, and profuse sweating occurs for 2 to 3 hours, followed by extreme fatigue. Fever is often hectic at the start of infection. In established infections, malarial paroxysms typically occur every 2 to 3 days depending on the species.

Splenomegaly usually becomes palpable by the end of the first week of clinical disease but may not occur with P. falciparum. The enlarged spleen is soft and prone to traumatic rupture. Splenomegaly may decrease with recurrent attacks of malaria as functional immunity develops. After many bouts, the spleen may become fibrotic and firm or, in some patients, becomes massively enlarged (tropical splenomegaly). Hepatomegaly usually accompanies splenomegaly.

P. falciparum manifestations
P. falciparum causes the most severe disease because of its microvascular effects. It is the only species likely to cause fatal disease if untreated; nonimmune patients may die within days of their initial symptoms. Temperature spikes and accompanying symptoms typically occur in an irregular pattern but can become synchronous, occurring in a tertian pattern (temperature spikes at 48-hour intervals), particularly in residents of endemic areas who are partially immune.

Patients with cerebral malaria may develop symptoms ranging from irritability to seizures and coma. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diarrhea, icterus, epigastric tenderness, retinal hemorrhages, algid malaria (a shocklike syndrome), and severe thrombocytopenia may also occur.

Renal insufficiency may result from volume depletion, vascular obstruction by parasitized erythrocytes, or immune complex deposition. Hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria resulting from intravascular hemolysis may progress to blackwater fever (so named based on the dark color of the urine), either spontaneously or after treatment with quinine.

Hypoglycemia is common and may be aggravated by quinine treatment and associated hyperinsulinemia.

Placental involvement may lead to low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or congenital infection.

P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi manifestations
P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae typically do not compromise vital organs. Mortality is rare and is mostly due to splenic rupture or uncontrolled hyperparasitemia in asplenic patients.

The clinical course with P. ovale is similar to that of P. vivax. In established infections, temperature spikes occur at 48-hour intervals—a tertian pattern.

P. malariae infections may cause no acute symptoms, but low-level parasitemia may persist for decades and lead to immune complex–mediated nephritis or nephrosis or tropical splenomegaly; when symptomatic, fever tends to occur at 72-hour intervals—a quartan pattern.

P. knowlesi is associated with the full spectrum of malaria. In contrast to P. falciparum, infection is more likely in males over 15 years living close to or working in forested areas. There are typically daily temperature spikes. Severity increases with the patient's age. The short asexual replication cycle of 24 hours can lead to high rates of parasitemia, and if untreated, death. Thrombocytopenia is common, but it is typically not associated with hemorrhage.

Manifestations in patients taking chemoprophylaxis
In patients who have been taking chemoprophylaxis (see table Drugs Used to Prevent Malaria), malaria may be atypical. The incubation period may extend weeks to months after the drug is stopped. Those infected may develop headache, backache, and irregular fever, but parasites may initially be difficult to find in blood samples.

Diagnosis of Malaria
Light microscopy of blood (thin and thick smears)

Rapid diagnostic tests that detect Plasmodium antigens or enzymes in blood

Fever and chills in an immigrant or traveler returning from an endemic region should prompt immediate assessment for malaria. Symptoms usually appear in the first 6 months after infection, but onset may take up to 2 years or, rarely, longer.

Malaria can be diagnosed by finding parasites on microscopic examination of thick or thin blood smears. The infecting species (which determines therapy and prognosis) is identified by characteristic features on smears (see table Diagnostic Features of Plasmodium Species in Blood Smears). If the initial blood smear is negative, additional smears should be repeated at 12- to 24-hour intervals until 3 smears are negative.

Thin blood smears stained with Wright-Giemsa stain allow assessment of parasite morphology within red blood cells (RBCs), often speciation, and determination of percentage parasitemia (parasite density), evaluated using oil immersion magnification of portions of the smear where RBCs are more or less touching, which should show about 400 RBCs per field. Thick smears are more sensitive but more difficult to prepare and interpret as the RBCs are lysed before staining. Sensitivity and accuracy of the results depend on the examiner's experience.

Commercial rapid diagnostic tests for malaria are based on the presence of certain plasmodium antigens or enzymatic activities. Assays may involve detection of a histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP-2) associated with malaria parasites (especially P. falciparum) and detection of plasmodium-associated lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH). The rapid diagnostic tests are generally comparable in sensitivity to microscopy in detecting low levels of parasitemia, but they do not differentiate single infection from concurrent infection with more than one Plasmodium species or allow speciation except for P. falciparum.

Light microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests are complementary, and both should be done when available. They have similar sensitivity. Negative results even in both does not exclude malaria in a patient with low parasitemia.

Polymerase chain reaction and species-specific DNA probes can be used but are not widely available at the point of care. They can help identify the infecting Plasmodium species after malaria is diagnosed. Because serologic tests may reflect prior exposure, they are not useful in the diagnosis of acute malaria.

Table
Diagnostic Features of Plasmodium Species in Blood Smears
Severity of malaria
Severe malaria is defined by the presence of one of more of the following clinical and laboratory features. Severe malaria tends to result from P. falciparum.

Clinical criteria for severe malaria:

Acute respiratory distress syndrome/pulmonary edema

Bleeding

Coma or impaired consciousness

Jaundice

Seizures (recurrent)

Shock

Laboratory criteria for severe malaria:

Anemia (severe: < 7 g/dL [70 g/L])

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)

Hemoglobinuria

Metabolic acidosis

Parasite density > 5%

Renal failure

Treatment of Malaria
Antimalarial drugs

Antimalarial drugs are chosen based on the following:

Disease severity (clinical and laboratory criteria)

Infecting Plasmodium species

Known resistance patterns of strains in the area of acquisition

Efficacy and adverse effects of drugs available

Artemisinin-based combination therapy, such as oral artemether/lumefantrine, is the most rapidly active treatment, and in many situations, it is the treatment of choice. Resistance to artemisinins has been reported but is not yet common.

Severe malaria requires urgent treatment, preferably with intravenous artesunate, which is the only drug available in the US for parenteral treatment of severe malaria (or for patients who cannot take drugs orally). If artesunate is not immediately available, start interim oral therapy with artemether/lumefantrine, atovaquone/proguanil, quinine sulfate (plus doxycycline or clindamycin intravenously), or if nothing else is available, mefloquine. In patients who are vomiting, an antiemetic may be helpful. Those who cannot swallow (eg, because of delirium) may be given crushed tablets of artemether/lumefantrine or atovaquone/proguanil through a nasogastric tube.

Due to the risk of progression to severe disease in patients with P. falciparum infection, patients should be hospitalized to monitor clinical response and to check parasite density every 12 to 24 hours until clinical presentation improves and a decrease in parasite density becomes apparent (see CDC: Treatment of Malaria: Guidelines for Clinicians [United States]).

Due to the risk of delayed hemolysis, which is a frequent complication in hyperparasitemic malaria treated with IV artesunate (1), hemoglobin levels should be monitored for 4 weeks after therapy.

Pearls & Pitfalls

Time is of the essence in treating severe malaria. Begin treatment with IV artesunate as soon as possible. Start interim oral therapy with other drugs if IV artesunate is not immediately available. 


In some endemic areas, a significant proportion of locally available antimalarial drugs are counterfeit. Thus, some clinicians advise travelers to remote, high-risk areas to take along a full course of an appropriate treatment regimen to be used if medically confirmed malaria is acquired despite prophylaxis; this strategy also avoids depleting limited drug resources in the destination country.

Malaria is particularly dangerous in children < 5 years (mortality is highest in those < 2 years), pregnant women, and previously unexposed visitors to endemic areas.

If P. falciparum is suspected, therapy should be initiated immediately, even if the initial smear and rapid diagnostic test are negative. P. falciparum resistance to antimalarial drugs is now widespread, and chloroquine-resistant P. vivax is common in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, and emerging in some other areas (eg, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Middle East, East Africa, and the Americas) (2).

For recommended drugs and doses for treatment and prevention of malaria, see tables Treatment of Malaria and Drugs Used to Prevent Malaria. Common adverse effects and contraindications are listed in table Adverse Reactions and Contraindications of Antimalarial Drugs. See also the CDC web site (Malaria Diagnosis and Treatment in the United States), or for emergency consultation about management, call the CDC Malaria Hotline at the numbers listed above.

In case of a febrile illness during travel in an endemic region, prompt professional medical evaluation is essential. When prompt evaluation is not possible (eg, because the region is very remote), self-medication with artemether/lumefantrine or atovaquone/proguanil can be considered pending evaluation. If travelers present with fever after returning from an endemic region and no other diagnosis is made, clinicians should consider giving empiric treatment for uncomplicated malaria even when malaria smears and/or rapid diagnostic tests are negative.

Prevention of Relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale Malaria
Hypnozoites must be eliminated from the liver with primaquine or tafenoquine to prevent relapses of P. vivax or P. ovale. Primaquine or tafenoquine may be given simultaneously with chloroquine or afterward. Some P. vivax strains are less sensitive, and relapse may occur, requiring repeated treatment. Primaquine is not necessary for P. falciparum or P. malariae because these species do not have a persistent hepatic phase. If exposure to P. vivax or P. ovale is intense or prolonged or if travelers are asplenic, a 14-day prophylactic course of primaquine or a single dose of tafenoquine starting when travelers return reduces the risk of recurrence. The main adverse effect is hemolysis in people with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. G6PD levels should be determined before primaquine or tafenoquine is given.

Primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy and breastfeeding, unless the infant has been shown not to be G6PD deficient. In pregnant women, chemoprophylaxis with weekly chloroquine can be given for the remainder of pregnancy, and after delivery, women can be given primaquine, provided they are not G6PD deficient.

Prevention of Malaria
Travelers to endemic regions should be given chemoprophylaxis (see table Drugs Used to Prevent Malaria). Information about countries where malaria is endemic is available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (see CDC: Yellow Fever and Malaria Information, by Country and CDC: Malaria); the information includes types of malaria, resistance patterns, geographic distribution, and recommended prophylaxis.

Table
Drugs Used to Prevent Malaria
Malaria during pregnancy poses a serious threat to both mother and fetus. Chloroquine can be used during pregnancy in areas where Plasmodium species are susceptible, but there is no other safe and effective prophylactic regimen, so pregnant women should avoid travel to chloroquine-resistant areas whenever possible. Treatment of malaria during pregnancy depends on infecting Plasmodium species and known resistance patterns in the area of acquisition (see CDC: Treatment of Malaria: Guidelines For Clinicians (United States): Alternatives for Pregnant Women).

The safety of mefloquine during pregnancy has not been documented, but limited experience suggests that it may be used when the benefits are judged to outweigh the risks. Doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, primaquine, and tafenoquine should not be used during pregnancy.

Artemisinins have a short half-life and are not useful for prophylaxis.

Prophylactic measures against mosquitoes include

Using permethrin- or pyrethrum-containing residual insecticide sprays (which have prolonged duration of action)

Placing screens on doors and windows

Using mosquito netting (preferably impregnated with permethrin or pyrethrum) around beds

Treating clothing and gear (eg, boots, pants, socks, tents) with products containing 0.5% permethrin, which remain protective through several washings (pretreated clothing is available and may protect longer)

Applying mosquito repellents such as DEET (diethyltoluamide) 25 to 35% to exposed skin

Wearing protective long-sleeved shirts and pants, especially between dusk and dawn, when Anopheles mosquitoes are active

People who plan to use repellents that contain DEET should be instructed to

Apply repellents only to exposed skin as directed on the label and use them sparingly around ears (they should not be applied to or sprayed in the eyes or mouth).

Wash hands after application.

Not allow children to handle repellents (adults should apply the repellent to their hands first, then gently spread it on the child's skin).

Apply just enough repellent to cover the exposed area.

Wash the repellant off after returning indoors.

Wash clothing before wearing again unless indicated otherwise by the product label.

Most repellents can be used on infants and children < 2 months. The Environmental Protection Agency does not recommend additional precautions for using registered repellents on children or on pregnant or breastfeeding women.

On October 6, 2021, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended widespread use of the RTS,S/AS01 (RTS,S) malaria vaccine among children in sub-Saharan Africa and in other regions with moderate to high P. falciparum malaria transmission. (See WHO recommends groundbreaking malaria vaccine for children at risk.)

Key Points
In 2020, there were an estimated 241 million people with malaria worldwide, and about 627,000 deaths occurred, mostly in children < 5 years in Africa; since 2000, deaths due to malaria have decreased by about 60%.

P. falciparum causes microvascular obstruction and tissue ischemia, particularly in the brain, kidneys, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract of nonimmune infants and adults; patients may die within days of their initial symptoms.

P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae typically do not compromise vital organs; mortality is rare. The full spectrum of malaria occurs with P. knowlesi. Its short asexual replication cycle can result in high parasitemia and severe, potentially fatal disease if untreated.

Manifestations include recurrent fever and rigor, headache, myalgia, and nausea; hemolytic anemia and splenomegaly are common.

Diagnose using light microscopy of blood (thin and thick smears) and rapid diagnostic blood tests.

Treat with antimalarial drugs based on the species (if known) and drug resistance patterns in the area in which infection was acquired.

Artemisinin-based therapy (eg, artemether/lumefantrine, artesunate, other artemisinin compounds) is the most rapidly active therapy; atovaquone plus proguanil is an alternative for patients with uncomplicated malaria.

Use primaquine or tafenoquine for confirmed or suspected infections with P. vivax and P. ovale to prevent relapse unless patients are pregnant, breastfeeding, have G6PD deficiency, or their G6PD status is unknown.

Severe malaria requires urgent treatment. Due to the risk of progression to severe disease in patients with P. falciparum infection, patients should be hospitalized to monitor clinical response.

Give chemoprophylaxis to travelers to endemic areas, and teach them ways to prevent mosquito bites.

More Information
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is a rare, usually fatal, acute central nervous system (CNS) infection caused by Naegleria fowleri.

Naegleria fowleri inhabit bodies of warm fresh water worldwide. Swimming in contaminated water exposes nasal mucosa to the organism, which can enter the CNS via olfactory neuroepithelium and the cribriform plate. Most patients are healthy children or young adults.

Symptoms and Signs
Symptoms of primary amebic meningoencephalitis begin within 1 to 2 weeks of exposure, sometimes with alteration of smell and taste. Fulminant meningoencephalitis ensues, with headache, meningismus, and mental status change, progressing to death within 10 days, usually due to cerebral herniation. Only a few patients have survived.

Diagnosis
Cerebrospinal fluid examination

Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is suspected based on history of swimming in fresh water, but confirmation is difficult because CT and routine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests, although necessary to exclude other causes, are nonspecific.

Wet mount of fresh, not refrigerated or frozen, CSF should be done; it may demonstrate motile amebic trophozoites (which can be seen in Giemsa-stained specimens but are destroyed by Gram stain techniques).

Immunohistochemistry, amebic culture, polymerase chain reaction of CSF, and/or brain biopsy are available in specialized reference laboratories. Consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other experts in the diagnosis of amebic encephalitis is recommended.

Treatment
Multiple drugs, including miltefosine plus antifungal drugs and antibiotics

Optimal treatment is unclear, but it must be started as soon as possible. Consultation with experts at the CDC is recommended (call the CDC Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100).

A regimen should include miltefosine, an antileishmanial drug, which has been used in combination with other drugs in the successful treatment of patients with primary amebic meningoencephalitis. Miltefosine has also been used successfully to treat encephalitis due to Balamuthia and Acanthamoeba. Miltefosine is now available commercially.

Other antimicrobial agents that have been used in combination treatment regimens for Naegleria include

Amphotericin B

Rifampin

An azole (fluconazole, voriconazole, or ketoconazole)

Azithromycin

Antiseizure drugs and dexamethasone are often needed to control seizures and cerebral edema. Aggressive management of cerebral edema with therapeutic hypothermia (cooling the body below normal body temperature) has also been associated with survival and neurologic recovery in recent cases.

Key Points
Primary amebic meningoencephalitis is rare, usually fatal.

The infection is acquired when swimming in contaminated fresh water; Naegleria fowleri enters the CNS via olfactory neuroepithelium and the cribriform plate.

Diagnostic tests should include a wet mount and Giemsa-stained specimen of CSF.

Treat the infection with multiple antimicrobial agents, including miltefosine; if needed, treat seizures and cerebral edema with antiseizure drugs and dexamethasone.

Survival is rare but, in recent cases, has been attributed to early diagnosis and treatment in combination with aggressive management of cerebral edema.
